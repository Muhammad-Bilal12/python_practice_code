# let's play with operators


# Arithmetic Operator

a = 6
b = 9
print('the value of a + b is : ', a+b)  #addition
print('the value of a - b is : ', a-b)  #subtract
print('the value of a * b is : ', a*b)  #multiplication
print('the value of a / b is : ', a/b)  #division
# Note* : Division always return floating values
print(4/2)
# Moduler Operator %
print('remainder : ', 63%2)


# Assignment Operator
# assigning operator is used assign value for variables

a = 3 # = basic assignment operator
print(a)
a +=4
print(a)
a -=4
print(a)
a *=4
print(a)
a /=4
print(a)


# Comparission Operator

# we used to chect some condition
#return boolean values like true or false 

a = 4
b = 5
# c = a>b #a greater than b
# c = a<b   #a less than b
# c = a<=b  #a greater than equal to b
# c = a>=b  #a less than equals to b
# c = a==b #equals to
c = a!=b #Not equals to
print(c)

# Logical Operator

# And Or Not

# it also return boolean values


a = True
b = False
print(a and b)
print(a or b)
print(not b)
